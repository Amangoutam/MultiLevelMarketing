    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) opportunities seem to be everywhere you turn these days, not only online, but in every part of your life
including school and church, where fervid entrepreneurs lobby even their bible study groups to buy their product or service.
Even police departments have been invaded by MLM schemes. The San Diego police department actually had an illegal pyramid scheme
discovered within one of its departments!

Equally prevalent are the misconceptions of what this business is and whether it really is a legitimate business or a scam. Trying 
to find "truth" in this morass of information is a challenge. The appeal of a business with minimal investment and a support system 
in place cannot be denied. But is this for real? Let's take a look.

One of the most confusing aspects of assessing the viability of many of the business "opportunities" being hyped is the variety of 
terms used to describe them. MLM is also frequently called network marketing, consumer direct marketing, or seller assisted marketing 
and other terms continue to surface.

    Multi-Level Marketing
    MLM is essentially any business where payouts occur at two or more levels. For instance, if you make a sale, both you and the 
    person who recruited you will get a portion of the proceeds. This is the most commonly used term partly because its definition
    fits within the legal restrictions for this type of business.

    Network Marketing
    Network Marketing means that a distributor network is needed to build the business. Usually such businesses are also MLM in nature
    in that payouts also occur at more than one level. The term Network Marketing is sometimes also incorrectly used to indicate that
    the business uses a network of product suppliers in order to offer a broader selection of products. Businesses that describe 
    themselves this way are usually trying to differentiate themselves, suggesting that their program is superior to other programs.

    Consumer Direct Marketing
    Consumer Direct Marketing is a deceptive term that labels the distribution chain as consumers rather than distributors. In such
    businesses the distributor must also buy the product for their personal use.

    Seller Assisted Marketing
    Seller Assisted Marketing Plans is a term used by California law to describe a variety of business forms which include MLM. A
    minimum $500 investment must be involved to qualify as a Seller Assisted Marketing Plan.

Here is some information to help you decide if this is a good path for you.
